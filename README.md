# Explainable-AI-Demos-with-SHAP
A comprehensive collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques using SHAP values across regression, classification, and deep learning models. This project illustrates how SHAP can make machine learning and neural network predictions more interpretable and trustworthy.
